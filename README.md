# Chess_API_Project

# About 
By making use of the API of a chess platform <a href = "https://lichess.org/">Lichess</a>.
In this API code, we have used an API token instead of the key, which works similarly to an API key.
We have added 5 queries for users to execute and extract data from the Lichess database.
